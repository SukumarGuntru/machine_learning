---Logistic Regression---
  I implemented logistic regression and applied it to two diﬀerent datasets
  logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university
  Suppose that I am the administrator of a university department and I want to determine 
  each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams. I have historical
  data from previous applicants that I can use as a training set for logistic regression. 
  For each training example, I have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision. 
  Our task is to build a classiﬁcation model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based 
  the scores from those two exams.
  1.1 Visualizing the data
Before starting to implement any learning algorithm, it is always good to visualize the data if possible. 
In the ﬁrst part of ex2.m, the code will load the data and display it on a 2-dimensional plot by calling the function plotData.
we will now complete the code in plotData so that it displays a ﬁgure like , where the axes are the two exam scores, and the positive and negative examples are shown with diﬀerent markers.
